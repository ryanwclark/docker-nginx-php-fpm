## Prerequisites and Assumptions and Assumptions
*  Assumes you are using some sort of SSL terminating reverse proxy such as:
   *  [Traefik](https://github.com/ryanwclark/docker-traefik)
   *  [Nginx](https://github.com/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager)
   *  [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)

## Installation

### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build -t (imagename) .`
### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ryanwclark/nginx-php-fpm) and is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
docker pull ryanwclark/nginx-php-fpm:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| PHP version | Alpine Base | Tag            | Debian Base | Tag           |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| latest      | edge        | `:alpine-edge` |             |               |

#### Multi Archictecture
Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v6`, `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/ryanwclark) my work so that I can work with various hardware. To see if this image supports multiple architecures, type `docker manifest (image):(tag)`

## Configuration

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.

### Persistent Storage

The container starts up and reads from `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` for some basic configuration and to listen on port 73 internally for Nginx Status responses. `/etc/nginx/conf.d` contains a sample configuration file that can be used to customize a nginx server block.

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory   | Description                |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| `/www/html` | Root Directory             |
| `/www/logs` | Nginx and php-fpm logfiles |

* * *
### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/ryanwclark/alpine) or [Debian Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/ryanwclark/debian) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`, `nano`,`vim`.
Be sure to view the following repositories to understand all the customizable options:

| Image                                                  | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| [OS Base](https://github.com/ryanwclark/docker-alpine/) | Customized Image based on Alpine Linux |
| [Nginx](https://github.com/ryanwclark/docker-nginx/)    | Nginx webserver                        |


#### Container Options

The container has an ability to work in 3 modes, `nginx-php-fpm` (default) is an All in One image with nginx and php-fpm working together, `nginx` will only utilize nginx however not the included php-fpm instance, allowing for connecting to multiple remote php-fpm backends, and finally `php-fpm` to operate PHP-FPM in standalone mode.


| Parameter        | Description                                                   | Default         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `CONTAINER_MODE` | Mode of running container `nginx-php-fpm`, `nginx`, `php-fpm` | `nginx-php-fpm` |

When `CONTAINER_MODE` set to `nginx` the `PHP_FPM_LISTEN_PORT` environment variable is ignored and the `PHP_FPM_HOST` variable defined below changes. You can add multiple PHP-FPM hosts to the backend in this syntax
<host>:<port> seperated by commas e.g `php-fpm-container1:9000,php-fpm-container2:9000`

*You can also pass arguments to each server as defined in the [Nginx Upstream Documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html)*

| Parameter                   | Description                                                    | Default                                   |

### Networking

The following ports are exposed.

| Port   | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `9000` | PHP-FPM     |


## Maintenance
Inside the image are tools to perform modification on how the image runs.

### Shell Access
For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell.

```bash
docker exec -it (whatever your container name is e.g. nginx-php-fpm) bash
```
### PHP Extensions
If you want to enable or disable or list what PHP extensions are available, type `php-ext help`

### Maintenance Mode
If you wish to turn the web server into maintenance mode showing a single page screen outlining that the service is being worked on, you can also enter into the container and type `maintenance ARG`, where ARG is either `ON`,`OFF`, or `SLEEP (seconds)` which will temporarily place the site in maintenance mode and then restore it back to normal after time has passed.
## Contributions
Welcomed. Please fork the repository and submit a [pull request](../../pulls) for any bug fixes, features or additions you propose to be included in the image. If it does not impact my intended usage case, it will be merged into the tree, tagged as a release and credit to the contributor in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG).

## Support

These images were built to serve a specific need in a production environment and gradually have had more functionality added based on requests from the community.
### Usage
- The [Discussions board](../../discussions) is a great place for working with the community on tips and tricks of using this image.

### Bugfixes
- Please, submit a [Bug Report](issues/new) if something isn't working as expected. I'll do my best to issue a fix in short order.

### Feature Requests
- Feel free to submit a feature request, however there is no guarantee that it will be added, or at what timeline.

### Updates
